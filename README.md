# Ageing Model Helper

## Overview
<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This package provides a set of convenience functions designed to support the development of ageing-related predictive models using DNA methylation values inferred from SNP genotypes.

Direct DNA methylation profiling can be costly or unavailable in many studies. As an alternative, this package helps researchers evaluate whether SNP-predicted methylation levels at CpG sites can serve as effective substitutes for measured methylation data in building epigenetic clocks and other ageing-related models.


## Installation

You can install the development version of somepackage from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Kemda-Imsid/MethAMSNP")
```
